# Text-Classification-using-BERT
the text classification model using the pre-trained BERT model
the text classification model using the pre-trained
BERT model, we are loading a train and test dataset, preprocesses the text data,
encodes the text data using BERT, and builds a model to predict the category of each
text. The pre-trained BERT model is used to encode the text data, and a neural network
is used as the classifier, we are using the TensorFlow library and predicting the
classification.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110291143/224362885-75aaf57f-73b7-4ce4-8faf-86e1a3586220.png)
